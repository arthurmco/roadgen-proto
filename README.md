# roadgen-proto

Generates a simple image containing roads (the white lines) and cities (the 
brown squares).

It will be a base for a Minecraft mod I will do in some months.

The way you run it is:

```
roadgen-proto.py <seed>
```

The seed is optional. (well, it is not exactly a seed in some places, specially in the road positioning)

You can use it as you wish.
